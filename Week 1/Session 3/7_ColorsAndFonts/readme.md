- Understand how to apply standard web-safe fonts to your HTML elements using CSS.
- Learn how to set text and background colors using CSS properties.
- Explore the importance of contrast and readability in web design.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to apply standard fonts and colors to my web page using CSS so that the text is readable and the page is visually appealing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The HTML page has been styled using CSS to apply standard fonts and colors.
- Web-safe fonts are used for the main text elements (e.g., `body`, `h1`, `p`).
- The background color and text color combinations are chosen for optimal contrast and readability.
- CSS properties such as `font-family`, `color`, and `background-color` are correctly implemented.
- The CSS is organized and well-commented to explain the choices made for fonts and colors.

## Steps to Complete

1. **Review the HTML Structure**:

   - Open the provided HTML file in your code editor. Familiarize yourself with the structure, including headings, paragraphs, and other text elements.

2. **Choose Web-Safe Fonts**:

   - Research web-safe fonts that are commonly supported across different browsers. Examples include `Arial`, `Verdana`, `Times New Roman`, `Georgia`, and `Courier New`.
   - Apply a default font to the `body` element using the `font-family` property.
   - Apply different fonts to headings (`h1`, `h2`, etc.) and paragraphs (`p`) to create a visual hierarchy.

3. **Set Text and Background Colors**:

   - Choose a background color for the page using the `background-color` property. Consider using light, neutral tones to ensure the text is readable.
   - Set the text color using the `color` property. Ensure there is enough contrast between the text and background for accessibility.

4. **Implement CSS Styles**:

   - Create a new external CSS file or add styles directly to the `<style>` section in your HTML file.
   - Apply the chosen fonts and colors to the appropriate elements.
   - Example:

     ```css
     /* Apply a web-safe font to the entire page */
     body {
       font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
       background-color: #f4f4f4;
       color: #333333;
     }

     /* Set a different font for headings */
     h1 {
       font-family: Georgia, serif;
       color: #2c3e50;
     }

     /* Style paragraphs with a web-safe font */
     p {
       font-family: "Verdana", sans-serif;
       color: #555555;
     }
     ```

5. **Test and Refine**:

   - Save your CSS and refresh the HTML page in your web browser to see the changes.
   - Adjust the fonts and colors as needed to improve the page's visual appeal and readability.

6. **Submit Your Work**:
   - Submit the HTML and CSS files. Be prepared to explain your font and color choices and how they enhance the readability and design of the page.
