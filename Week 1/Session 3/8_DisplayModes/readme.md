# Exercise: Fix the Display Modes in CSS

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will fix the display modes of elements on a webpage. A couple of elements are incorrectly displayed, including one element that is hidden (due to `display: none`) and another pair of elements that should be displayed horizontally side-by-side but are currently stacked vertically.

Your task is to apply the correct CSS display properties (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`) to fix these issues and ensure that the page displays the elements correctly.

## Key Learnings:

- Understanding the different CSS display modes: `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`.
- Modifying display properties to control how elements appear on the webpage.
- Debugging CSS to fix common layout issues.

## User Story:

As a developer, I want to understand how different CSS display properties work so that I can control the layout of elements on a webpage and fix display issues.

---

## Acceptance Criteria:

1. **Hidden Element Fix**: A certain element is hidden on the page due to `display: none`. You need to make this element visible by changing its `display` property.
2. **Horizontal Layout Fix**: Two elements that are currently stacked vertically should be displayed horizontally next to each other. You must modify the `display` properties to achieve this.
3. **Proper Use of Display Modes**: Use `block`, `inline`, and `inline-block` display modes appropriately to achieve the correct layout.
4. **Layout Should Match the Given Design**: The webpage layout should match the design once the CSS issues are resolved, with all elements visible and positioned as intended.

## Final Layout:

After fixing the CSS:

The hidden text should be visible.
The two item divs should appear horizontally aligned, next to each other, rather than stacked.
Good luck!
