# Wireframing and Layout Planning

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will use a tool like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets to plan and design a basic 3x3 website layout. This design will help you scope and visualize the structure of a commercial web page. A 3x3 layout typically consists of the following sections:

1. **Banner** – the top area of the page, usually for branding or a hero image.
2. **Three Option Boxes** – often used to highlight key features or services.
3. **News/About Section** – a lower section for business updates or an "About" description.

Once you've wireframed the layout in your chosen tool, you will translate your design into a semantic HTML structure, considering containing elements (divs, sections, etc.) and using semantic HTML tags like `<header>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Learn how to scope and plan the layout of a commercial web page from a business and development perspective.
- Understand how to use wireframing tools to organize content visually and logically.
- Practice using **semantic HTML elements** to improve the accessibility and structure of your web page.
- Gain insight into how developers plan layouts that balance design and functionality.

## User Story

As a web designer, I want to plan the layout of a commercial website using wireframing tools, so that I can visually map out key content areas before starting the development process.

As a developer, I want to implement a web page structure using semantic HTML, so that the site is accessible, well-structured, and easy to maintain.

## Acceptance Criteria

- You must design a wireframe of a 3x3 web page layout in either Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, or another similar tool.
  - **The layout must include**:
    - A banner section.
    - Three option boxes below the banner.
    - A section at the bottom for either news or an "About" section.
- Your wireframe should demonstrate clear visual hierarchy, with attention to alignment and spacing.
- You must create an HTML file that translates your wireframe into code using semantic HTML elements.
  - Use appropriate semantic tags (`<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
  - Ensure each section of the page is logically structured.
- Your code should be clean, and formatted with comments explaining the purpose of each major section.

## Example Layout Flow

1. **Banner**: Located at the top, typically containing the company logo or headline.
2. **Option Boxes**: A row of three boxes that display key features, products, or services.
3. **News/About Section**: A dedicated section at the bottom for either latest business updates or a brief company bio.
