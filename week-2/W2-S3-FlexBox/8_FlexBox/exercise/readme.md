# FlexBox and Flex Wrap

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will be provided with an example web page and stylesheet that utilizes `display: flex` and `flex-wrap: wrap` to create a responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes. Your task is to study the existing CSS and HTML, focusing on the areas marked with `TODO` comments. Experiment with the styles in question and use resources like the [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) to deepen your understanding of how these properties work.

You can use your browser’s Element Inspector to experiment with the page layout in real time, adjusting the CSS to observe changes and test different configurations.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Develop a strong understanding of **Flexbox** and its key properties.
- Learn how to use `flex-wrap` to handle content overflow and achieve flexible layouts.
- Gain practical experience in making web pages responsive for different screen sizes.
- Understand how Flexbox can be applied to real-world web applications for dynamic, responsive layouts.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to understand how to use Flexbox and flex-wrap to create layouts that are responsive and flexible, so that I can build web applications that adapt smoothly to different screen sizes and devices.

## Acceptance Criteria

- You must experiment with the CSS and HTML provided in the starter code, specifically in areas marked with `TODO` comments.
- The layout should be flexible and responsive, adapting to different screen widths without breaking the design.
- Use the following Flexbox properties effectively:
  - `display: flex`
  - `flex-wrap`
- In the stylesheet, provide comments next to the `TODO` sections to explain:
  - How the specific Flexbox properties work.
  - What changes were made and how they affect the layout.
- Make use of the browser’s Developer Tools (Element Inspector) to dynamically test and adjust your layout.

## Example Flow

1. Start with the provided HTML and CSS.
2. Identify `TODO` comments in the CSS file that prompt you to experiment with certain Flexbox properties.
3. Use the [CSS Tricks Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) as a reference to adjust and understand the behavior of each property.
4. Modify the flexbox layout using different properties to observe how elements behave in different screen sizes, especially focusing on how `flex-wrap` allows content to wrap onto new lines when space is limited.
5. Document your changes with comments in the CSS.
