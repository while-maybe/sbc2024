# Transitions and Transformations

## Challenge

Your client, **Wally's Wellies**, wants to add more interactive features to his website after seeing the animations on **Dave's Dogfood**. Wally was impressed with pulsing boxes and spinning images, which Dave claims have increased customer interaction and boosted sales. Not wanting to be outdone, Wally wants you to add similar effects to his site.

Your task is to implement **CSS transitions and transformations** to make Wally's Wellies more interactive and animated. You can either use the provided example code or build on your previous work from the **2_BorderStyling** exercise.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- The difference between **CSS transitions** and **CSS transformations**.
- How to use transitions and transformations to create interactive elements in a real-world web application.
- Best practices for animating elements to improve user engagement without overwhelming the user experience.

## User Story

As a web developer, I want to use CSS transitions and transformations to create smooth, interactive animations, so that I can improve user engagement and create a more modern, dynamic website for Wally's Wellies.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Animations:

1. Add a **pulsing effect** to one or more of Wally's Wellies' product boxes.

   - The box should smoothly grow and shrink in size using CSS transitions.
   - The animation should loop continuously to simulate a pulsing effect.

2. Add a **spinning effect** to images (e.g., product images or logo).
   - When a user hovers over the image, it should smoothly rotate 360 degrees.
   - The rotation should happen over a specific duration (e.g., 2 seconds) and only trigger on hover.

### General:

- All animations should feel smooth and not disrupt the layout of the page.
- Ensure that the animations are compatible across modern browsers and devices.
- Keep the design professional and in line with the branding of Wallyâ€™s Wellies.
