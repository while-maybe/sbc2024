# CSS Variables

## Challenge

You have an existing webpage where primary and secondary colors are used across many different styles in the CSS. Recently, your client underwent a rebranding exercise, and the colors used on the page need to be updated. Rather than hardcoding the colors multiple times across the stylesheet, you’ve decided to migrate to CSS variables. This will make future color or style changes much easier to manage.

Your challenge is to refactor the existing CSS stylesheet to use CSS variables for both the primary and secondary colors.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand what CSS variables are and how they can be used to streamline your styling process.
- Learn how to implement and utilize CSS variables for colors and other styles.
- Explore real-world use cases where CSS variables can make it easier to manage future changes, such as rebranding, theming, or rapid style adjustments.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to refactor my CSS to use variables for colors so that it's easier to maintain and make changes to the design system in the future, especially for large-scale projects or rebranding exercises.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Define CSS variables for the primary and secondary colors at the top of the stylesheet.
- Refactor the existing CSS rules to use these variables instead of hardcoded color values.
- The functionality and layout of the page should not be altered—only the color management should change.
- The primary color should be applied to headings, buttons, and links.
- The secondary color should be applied to backgrounds, borders, or other secondary elements.
