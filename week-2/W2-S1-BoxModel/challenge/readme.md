# Doing more with CSS Variables

## Challenge

During the exercise for 3_CSSVariables, you migrated colors within your stylesheet to use CSS Variables, however it's not just colours that can be stored within variables.

Your challenge is to further refactor the existing CSS stylesheet to use CSS variables for elements other than colours.

- Consider using CSS variables for other reusable values like font sizes, spacings (e.g., margins, padding), and shadows.

- Try adding a dark mode theme by defining a new set of variables and applying them conditionally based on user preferences (`@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`).

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand what CSS variables are and how they can be used to streamline your styling process.
- Learn how to implement and utilize CSS variables for borders, margins and other re-usable styling parameters.

- Explore real-world use cases where CSS variables can make it easier to manage future changes, such as rebranding, theming, or rapid style adjustments.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to refactor my CSS to use variables for font sizes, spacings (e.g., margins, padding), and shadows so that it's easier to maintain and make changes to the design system in the future, especially for large-scale projects or rebranding exercises.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Define CSS variables for fonts and sizing at the top of the stylesheet.
- Refactor the existing CSS rules to use these variables instead of hardcoded color values.
- The functionality and layout of the page should not be alteredâ€”only the color management should change.
