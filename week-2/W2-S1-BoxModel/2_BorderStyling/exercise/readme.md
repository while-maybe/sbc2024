# Landing Page Modernisation

## Challenge

Wally's Wellies, an outdoor boot shop, currently has a simple landing page that includes a navigation bar, a home page banner, and four boxes displaying the types of wellies Wally sells. These boxes are currently styled with plain black borders.

Wally wants to modernize the look of the landing page to appeal to a younger audience. Your challenge is to add modern styling to the page by:

- Rounding the corners of the boxes using `border-radius`.
- Softening the appearance of the boxes with border techniques like lighter colors and shadows (`box-shadow`).
- Adding depth to the boxes by using the `box-shadow` property to create a subtle 3D effect.

You'll find a starting HTML page and CSS file that provides the basic structure and layout. Your task is to update the CSS to create a more modern, polished appearance.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand how different border styles (like `border-radius`, `border-color`, and `box-shadow`) can significantly alter the aesthetics of a web page.
- Learn how to apply `box-shadow` to give elements a more modern, dimensional look.
- Gain experience in applying modern design techniques to improve user experience and visual appeal.
- Use CSS properties to create softer, more rounded designs to make websites look more approachable and up-to-date.

## User Story

As a web designer, I want to update the styling of Wally's Wellies landing page so that it appeals to a younger market by modernizing the look of the product boxes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The corners of all product boxes should be rounded using the `border-radius` property.
- The borders of the boxes should use lighter colors to create a softer appearance.
- Each box should include a subtle `box-shadow` to give it a modern, lifted look.
- The landing page layout should remain the same, but the boxes should appear more polished and visually appealing.
- The changes should be made entirely with CSS, without altering the HTML structure.
