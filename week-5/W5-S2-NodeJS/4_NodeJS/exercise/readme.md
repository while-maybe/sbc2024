# NodeJS and Debugging

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will:

1. Install **NodeJS** on your machine.
2. Start a simple Node.js application by running `node index.js` from the command line.
3. Learn how to **debug** and step through code using the Node.js debugging tools.
4. The provided `index.js` contains a Fibonacci sequence function, which demonstrates **recursive functions**. You will explore how recursion works and how to navigate through code execution.

By the end, you should be able to explain how the Fibonacci function works, and youâ€™ll be able to:

- **Step into** functions.
- **Step over** lines of code.
- Set and run code up to **breakpoints**.

## Key Learnings

- Understand **what NodeJS is** and its use cases.
- Learn how to run a simple Node.js application using the command line.
- Gain debugging skills by stepping into and over code execution, and using breakpoints.
- Understand recursive functions through the Fibonacci sequence example.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to install Node.js, run a JavaScript application, and be able to debug it by stepping through the code. I want to understand how recursion works using the Fibonacci function example.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Node.js is installed correctly on your machine.
- You can run the command `node index.js` successfully and see the output of the Fibonacci sequence in the terminal.
- You can initiate the **debugger** using Node.js built-in debugging tools or an IDE like VSCode, and:
  - **Step into** the recursive function to see how the function calls itself.
  - **Step over** code lines to skip unnecessary details during debugging.
  - Set and run code up to **breakpoints** within the `index.js` file.
- You can explain how the Fibonacci recursive function works.
- You can effectively debug and describe the process of stepping into, stepping over, and setting breakpoints.
