# Modern JavaScript

## Challenge

In this challenge, you will review and run code samples from the provided JavaScript files to understand the differences between **modern ES6/ES7 JavaScript** and traditional JavaScript. Some of the concepts may be new to you, so use this exercise as a reference and learning opportunity.

You will explore the following modern JavaScript concepts:

- **Object destructuring**
- **Default function parameters**
- **Async/Await**
- **Let/Const/Var** for variable declarations
- **Modules** (import/export)

By running and modifying the provided code, you will begin to understand these features and their advantages over traditional approaches.

## Key Learnings

- Understand the differences between traditional JavaScript and modern **ES6/ES7**.
- Learn how to use **object destructuring** to simplify code.
- Understand how **default function parameters** work.
- Grasp the benefits of using **async/await** for asynchronous code.
- Know when to use **let**, **const**, and **var** for declaring variables.
- Gain exposure to using **modules** for structuring JavaScript code.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to explore the key features of modern JavaScript (ES6 and ES7) so that I can apply these concepts in real-world applications and write cleaner, more efficient code.

## Acceptance Criteria

- You can explain the differences between **let**, **const**, and **var**, and when to use each one.
- You can modify and run code that demonstrates **object destructuring** and understand how it simplifies code.
- You can explain and use **default function parameters** in functions.
- You can successfully write asynchronous functions using **async/await** and understand its advantages over traditional callback functions or Promises.
- You can work with **JavaScript modules** by using `import` and `export` syntax.
- You have reviewed and understood all code samples provided in the JavaScript files.
