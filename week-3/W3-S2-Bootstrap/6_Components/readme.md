# Bootstrap Components

## Challenge

Bootstrap provides a number of pre-made components, from navbars to progress bars and more, that you can use and customize. Your challenge is to examine a well-known website, like [https://www.microsoft.com/](https://www.microsoft.com/), and identify how many of the elements on the home page could be built using Bootstrap components.

You will be provided with a starter HTML page to test code snippets and experiment with Bootstrap components. Use the official Bootstrap documentation for reference: [Bootstrap Components Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/).

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand the range and type of components available in Bootstrap.
- Learn how to identify common real-world website elements that can be implemented with Bootstrap.
- Gain experience in experimenting with and customizing Bootstrap components.
- Practice analyzing web design and breaking it down into reusable components.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to examine a popular website's homepage and identify which UI elements can be built using Bootstrap components. I want to implement a few of those elements using Bootstrap to better understand how pre-made components can speed up development and ensure consistency in design.

## Acceptance Criteria

- You must examine the homepage of a well-known website (e.g., Microsoft) and identify at least **5 different elements** that could be built using Bootstrap components (e.g., navbars, buttons, cards, etc.).
- For each identified element, note down which Bootstrap component(s) would be appropriate to replicate that element.
- Using the provided starter HTML file, implement at least **3 of these identified elements** using Bootstrap. You may need to customize the components to match the style and functionality of the original website.
- Ensure your implementation includes at least one **navigation component** (e.g., a navbar), one **content layout component** (e.g., a card, grid system), and one **interactive element** (e.g., buttons, modals).
- Your code should be clean, structured, and well-commented where necessary to explain the Bootstrap components used.

## Getting Started

1. Use the index.htm file in this folder as a starter, add your code after the comments
<!-- INSERT YOUR OWN CHOICE OF COMPONENTS HERE -->
2. Visit [https://www.microsoft.com/](https://www.microsoft.com/) or another popular website and identify elements on their homepage that align with Bootstrap components.
3. Use the [official Bootstrap documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/) to experiment with the identified components in your starter HTML file.
4. Implement at least 3 components and customize them to resemble the website as closely as possible.

Good luck!
