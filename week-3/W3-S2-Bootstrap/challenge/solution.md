### Answer 1
Components that could have been used:

#### for all pages:
- Navbar replacing the header and footer
- Bootstrap buttons can replace my own buttons
- Jumbotron
- A Carousel or 3 individual cards (in a container) can replace the 3 individual items I have on the main page advertised as services
- A modal could be used when the user clicks the log-in button at the top right button in the NavBar


### Answer 2:
These components can replace custom code:
- Styled buttons
- NavBar
- Card (with images)
- Placeholders (in my example can make the page a bit fuller)
- Form (has a lot of custom code)

Grid layouts:
- Bootstrap grid system can be used in both the services section, news area in the home page and the services in the services page.

note: Although the week2 challenge did not incorporate responsiveness as this was only learned in week 3, it can be more easily incorporated with bootstrap as opposed to using extensive media queries.
