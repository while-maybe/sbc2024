# Using Bootstrap within an Existing Website

## Challenge

In Week 2, you developed a multi-page responsive website. Now, review your submitted site and consider how Bootstrap could have been used to achieve the same result. Identify which Bootstrap components, grid systems, and utility classes could have been used to build your site more efficiently. Keep a list of the components you identify, as it may come in handy for future exercises.

This exercise will help you learn how to plan web development projects using frameworks like Bootstrap, which offer pre-built components and responsive design tools that can simplify development.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand the practical application of Bootstrap in real-world website projects.
- Learn how to identify and incorporate Bootstrap components to replace custom code.
- Enhance your planning skills by assessing how frameworks like Bootstrap can simplify and speed up the web development process.
- Gain experience in mapping existing site structures to a framework's tools and features.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to evaluate how Bootstrap components and utilities can replace custom solutions in my previously developed responsive website to improve efficiency and maintainability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Review your multi-page responsive website from Week 2.
- Identify at least **three Bootstrap components** that could have been used instead of custom-built elements (e.g., Navbar, Cards, Modals).
- Create a list of the components, grid layouts, and utility classes that could have replaced your custom code.
- Ensure that your list includes a brief explanation of why you chose each Bootstrap component.
- The final list should include:
  - Components and utilities for navigation, layout, forms, buttons, or any other elements.
  - A summary explaining how Bootstrap could have simplified your site's development process.

## Getting Started

1. **Review your Week 2 site:**

   - Open the code and design of the multi-page website you built in Week 2.

2. **Research Bootstrap components:**

   - Explore the [Bootstrap Components Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/) to familiarize yourself with the various pre-built components Bootstrap provides, such as Navbar, Carousel, Buttons, Forms, and Cards.

3. **List the components and utilities:**

   - Go through your website and make a list of the areas where you could have used Bootstrap components and utilities instead of custom CSS/HTML/JavaScript.
   - Use the list to map each Bootstrap component to a specific feature on your website.

4. **Document your findings:**
   - For each Bootstrap component, provide a brief explanation of how it could replace or enhance your existing code.
   - Consider grid systems, utilities (e.g., spacing, alignment), and responsive breakpoints.

## Example

Here’s an example of how you might document one of your findings:

- **Navigation Bar:**

  - **Original:** I built a custom navigation bar using custom HTML and CSS.
  - **Bootstrap Alternative:** I could have used Bootstrap’s [Navbar component](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/components/navbar/), which provides a responsive, pre-built navigation bar with support for toggling in mobile view. This would have saved time and provided a more consistent design.

- **Grid Layout:**
  - **Original:** I manually created a flexible grid system using CSS Flexbox.
  - **Bootstrap Alternative:** I could have used the Bootstrap [Grid System](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/layout/grid/), which handles responsiveness and layout without the need for custom Flexbox code.
