# Understanding Bootstrap

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will review a simple web page layout using Bootstrap, which includes a sidebar and content elements. Your task is to examine the code in `index.html`, where you will find `TODO` comments prompting you to explain the purpose of specific Bootstrap code snippets. These comments will guide you through understanding how the layout is structured and styled using Bootstrap.

For further reading and reference, check the official Bootstrap documentation: [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/).
