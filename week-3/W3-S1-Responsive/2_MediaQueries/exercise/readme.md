# Understanding Media Queries

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will explore how **CSS Media Queries** work. Using the provided web page, you will review the media queries in the `style.css` file and add comments to explain what each media query does. You will also experiment with resizing the browser window to observe how the media queries respond to different screen sizes.

### Objective

- Analyze the media queries already implemented in the `style.css`.
- Add comments describing the functionality of each media query marked with a **TODO**.
- Experiment by resizing the browser window to see how the layout and styles adapt.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand what CSS Media Queries are.
- Learn how media queries allow you to create responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes.
- Recognize how media queries can be applied to target specific devices or screen dimensions.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to understand how media queries control the layout and design of a website based on screen size, so I can create responsive, user-friendly applications.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Each media query in the `style.css` file must have a comment explaining its purpose and how it affects the layout.
- The comments should be clear, concise, and describe the breakpoints and styling adjustments made in the media queries.
- Upon resizing the browser, you should see the layout and styling changes in action, verifying the functionality of the media queries.

## Instructions

1. **Open the Project**: Start by opening the provided HTML and CSS files.
2. **Review the Media Queries**: In the `style.css` file, you will find several media queries marked with **TODO**. Analyze the CSS properties within each media query.
3. **Add Comments**: For each media query, add a comment describing:
   - The **breakpoint** it targets (e.g., max-width or min-width).
   - What styles or layout changes occur at this breakpoint.
4. **Experiment**: Resize the browser window to different widths and observe how the web page adjusts based on the media queries.
5. **Test Your Understanding**: Make sure the comments reflect the actual behavior of the media queries by verifying changes as you experiment with different screen sizes.
