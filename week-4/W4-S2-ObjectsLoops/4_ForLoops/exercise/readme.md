# JavaScript for Loops and More Loops

## Challenge

In this exercise, you'll be working with JavaScript's `for` loop to deepen your understanding of its mechanics and flexibility. You'll begin with a simple for loop example and then modify and extend it by creating three additional for loops, each with different starting points, ending points, and increments.

### Tasks:

- Start with a basic for loop example provided.
- Implement the following three for loop variations:
  1. A loop that starts at 50 and loops until 100.
  2. A loop that starts at 0 and loops to 50, incrementing by 5 each iteration.
  3. A loop that starts at 100 and counts down to 1.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand the structure of a `for` loop, including the initialization, condition, and iteration expressions.
- Learn how to control loop behavior by changing the start, stop, and increment/decrement values.
- Recognize the versatility of `for` loops in various programming scenarios.

## User Story

As a developer learning JavaScript, I want to understand how the `for` loop works so that I can apply it to different kinds of iteration tasks, such as counting up, counting down, and using increments other than 1.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] You start with a simple `for` loop example to serve as a reference.
- [ ] You have successfully created a `for` loop that starts at 50 and loops up to 100, inclusive.
- [ ] You have implemented a `for` loop that starts at 0 and increments by 5 each time, stopping at 50.
- [ ] You have written a `for` loop that starts at 100 and counts down to 1.
- [ ] Each loop must output the loop variable value to the console during each iteration.
- [ ] Ensure the code is clean and easy to read with appropriate comments explaining each loop's purpose.

## Example Starting Code:

```javascript
// Example of a basic for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

## Useful Resources for Learning JavaScript For Loops

Here are some excellent online resources to help you master JavaScript `for` loops and their variations:

### 1. [MDN Web Docs (Mozilla Developer Network)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for)

MDN offers a clear explanation of the `for` loop syntax, with examples and variations. This is one of the most authoritative references for JavaScript.

### 2. [W3Schools - JavaScript for Loop](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_loop_for.asp)

A beginner-friendly tutorial with interactive examples to practice how `for` loops work.

### 3. [JavaScript.info - Loops](https://javascript.info/while-for)

This is a more in-depth explanation of loops in JavaScript, including the `for` loop. It provides a conceptual breakdown of how loops function and various use cases.

### 4. [freeCodeCamp - JavaScript Loops](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-javascript/iterate-with-javascript-for-loops)

freeCodeCamp provides an interactive and hands-on environment where you can practice `for` loops within the broader scope
