# Object Methods

## Challenge

In JavaScript, you can create your own methods on objects, but there are also many built-in methods for objects, arrays, and strings. This exercise will help you understand some of the most commonly used built-in methods in JavaScript.

You are provided with code samples in the `script.js` file that demonstrate various built-in methods for objects, arrays, and strings. Your task is to run the code in your browser and analyze the output. After that, you will add comments after the `TODO` lines in the code to explain:

- What each method does.
- What the output of each method is.

## Key Learnings

- Understanding built-in JavaScript methods for objects, arrays, and strings.
- Being able to identify, explain, and use common methods.
- Analyzing code behavior by observing outputs in the browser.

## User Story

As a JavaScript developer,  
I want to become familiar with built-in methods for objects, arrays, and strings,  
So that I can use them efficiently in my code.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Running the Code**:

   - Open the provided index.htm file in Live Preview/Server in order to run `script.js` file in a browser environment (such as the browserâ€™s developer console or a JS editor that supports direct execution).
   - Review the output produced by each method in the code.

2. **Commenting on Methods**:

   - After each `TODO` comment in the code, add a comment explaining:
     - What the method is doing.
     - The output of the method.
   - Your comments should provide clarity on how the method works and what result it generates.

3. **Example**:

   - For example, if the code contains something like:
     ```javascript
     const person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
     console.log(Object.keys(person)); // TODO: Add comment here
     ```
