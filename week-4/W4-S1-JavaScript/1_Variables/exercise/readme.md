# Introduction to Variables in JavaScript

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will learn how to include JavaScript within a web page and store data in different types of variables. You will explore how to add numerical values stored in variables and, when dealing with string data types, how to concatenate them. This will help you get familiar with basic variable handling in JavaScript, working with data types, and using the browser console for debugging and testing.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Learn how to include and use JavaScript in an HTML web page.
- Understand the different types of variables in JavaScript (e.g., `var`, `let`, `const`).
- Learn how to declare variables and assign values to them.
- Practice adding numerical variables.
- Learn how to concatenate string variables.
- Gain experience using the browser console to test and debug your code.

## User Story

As a beginner JavaScript developer, I want to create a simple webpage that uses JavaScript to declare and manipulate variables, so I can understand how data is stored and manipulated in a browser environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **HTML and JavaScript Setup**:

   - A basic HTML page should be created.
   - JavaScript should be included in the HTML page using either a `<script>` tag or an external JavaScript file.

2. **Variable Declaration and Assignment**:

   - Store different types of data (e.g., a number, a string) in the variables.

3. **Adding Variables**:

   - Create a scenario where two numerical variables are added together, and the result is stored in a new variable.
   - Log the result to the browser console.

4. **String Concatenation**:

   - Create two string variables.
   - Concatenate them into a new variable, and log the result to the browser console.

5. **Use of the Browser Console**:

   - Ensure that all outputs (addition of numbers and string concatenation) are logged and visible in the browser's console.
   - Provide instructions on how to open the console in the browser for testing the outputs.

6. **Clear Comments**:
   - Add comments in the code explaining each step and its purpose.

## Additional Requirements

- Make sure to test your code in a browser by opening the HTML file.
- Use descriptive variable names that make your code easy to understand.
