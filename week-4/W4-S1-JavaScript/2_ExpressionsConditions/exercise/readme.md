# JavaScript Expressions and Conditions

## Challenge

In this exercise, you'll learn how to use basic comparison operators and understand how expressions are evaluated in JavaScript. You will also explore the difference between strict (`===`) and value (`==`) comparisons. These concepts will then be applied using `if/else` conditional statements to make decisions based on different conditions.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Understand common comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `===`, and `!=`.
- Learn the difference between strict comparison (`===`) and value comparison (`==`).
- Learn how to write basic `if/else` conditional statements to evaluate conditions and execute different blocks of code based on the outcome of those conditions.
- Practice using expressions inside conditional statements.

## User Story

As a beginner JavaScript developer, I want to practice using comparison operators and `if/else` statements so I can control the flow of my programs based on different conditions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Variable Declaration and Assignment**:
   - Declare at least three variables, each storing a different value (a string, a number, or a boolean).
2. **Using Comparison Operators**:

   - Use at least two different comparison operators (e.g., `>`, `<=`, `==`, `===`) to compare the variables.
   - Store the result of each comparison in a new variable.
   - Log the comparison results to the browser console.

3. **Strict vs. Value Comparison**:

   - Demonstrate the difference between `==` and `===` by comparing variables with similar values but different data types (e.g., `5` and `"5"`).
   - Log both comparison results to the console with explanations.

4. **Conditional Statements**:

   - Write an `if/else` statement to check the result of a comparison expression and execute different blocks of code depending on the condition.
   - Log a message to the console indicating whether the condition was met or not.

5. **Clear Comments**:
   - Add comments to explain what each comparison and conditional statement is doing.

## Additional Requirements

- Use descriptive variable names for better code readability.
- Test your code in the browser console and ensure all outputs are visible.
