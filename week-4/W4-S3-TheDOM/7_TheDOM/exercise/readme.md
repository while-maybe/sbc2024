# Introducing the DOM

## Challenge

In this exercise, you will uncomment each line of code in the `script.js` file and examine the browser's console to observe the output. The goal is to better understand how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM). You'll need to refer to the following resources to answer the questions provided in the comments of the code:

- [W3Schools: JavaScript HTML DOM](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp)
- [MDN: Using the DOM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Using_the_Document_Object_Model)

## Key Learnings

By the end of this exercise, you should understand the following:

- What the Document Object Model (DOM) is.
- How the DOM represents an HTML document in a tree structure.
- What parts of the DOM can be accessed and manipulated using JavaScript.
- The role of JavaScript in interacting with and updating the DOM.

## User Story

As a developer learning JavaScript, I want to understand how JavaScript interacts with the Document Object Model (DOM) so that I can manipulate web pages dynamically and respond to user input.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The `script.js` file contains several commented-out lines of code. For each block of code, you will:
  - Uncomment the code.
  - Open the browser console to see the output or any changes in the DOM.
  - Answer any questions that are commented in the code, based on the provided documentation.
- [ ] You will review and explore the resources from W3Schools and MDN to deepen your understanding of each concept.
- [ ] You will ensure that by the end of the exercise, all the code is running successfully, and the DOM manipulation techniques are clear.

## Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. In the `script.js` file, uncomment the first block of code and observe the output in the browser's console.
3. After examining the result, refer to the commented questions in the code and answer them by referring to the resources.
4. Repeat for each block of code until the entire `script.js` file has been examined and all questions are answered.
