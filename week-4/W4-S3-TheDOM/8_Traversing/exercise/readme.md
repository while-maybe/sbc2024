# Element Selection

## Challenge

Using the code in the `example` folder as a guide, complete the following tasks to modify the content of the web page using JavaScript:

1. Change the color of all the `<li>` elements to blue.
2. Change the text of the `<h2>` element in the first widget from "Statistics" to "Reports."
3. Change the text in the `<p>` tag in the third widget to “Optimise performance metrics here.”

## Key Learnings

By the end of this exercise, you should understand the following:

- How to select individual and multiple elements from the DOM.
- How to manipulate text, styles, and attributes of DOM elements using JavaScript.
- How to target elements based on their hierarchy or specific class, tag, or ID selectors.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to be able to select and manipulate specific elements within an HTML document so that I can dynamically update content and styles based on user interaction or logic.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All `<li>` elements have their text color changed to blue.
- [ ] The `<h2>` text in the first widget is changed from "Statistics" to "Reports."
- [ ] The text inside the `<p>` element in the third widget is changed to “Optimise performance metrics here.”
- [ ] All changes should be done through JavaScript by selecting appropriate DOM elements using methods like `document.querySelector()`, `document.querySelectorAll()`, or similar.

## Instructions

1. Open the `index.html` file from the `example` folder in your browser to view the default content.
2. In the `script.js` file, write the necessary JavaScript code to make the required changes.
3. Use JavaScript methods like `document.querySelector()`, `document.querySelectorAll()`, `textContent`, and `style` to manipulate the DOM.
4. Refresh the page after saving your changes to see the effects in the browser.
