# Images in React

## Challenge

You've just styled a Contact App, but there's one big thing missing... images! In this exercise, you will explore the different ways to include images in a React app. You’ll have some image files to use locally, but also consider using images from external URLs or services like [Pravatar](https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=fake@pravatar.com).

Use online resources and the React documentation to learn how to work with images in various ways within a React app.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Learn how to incorporate images from both local and public resources into a React application.
- Understand how to handle various image formats and sources within React components.
- Explore best practices for loading and optimizing images in React.

- [Adding Images, Fonts, and Files in Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-images-fonts-and-files/)

## User Story

As a developer, I want to practice using images from different sources and formats in a React app so that I can make my application more dynamic and visually appealing.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The Contact App displays an avatar or image for each contact, sourced from either local files or an external URL.
- [ ] Local image files are added and displayed within the React components.
- [ ] At least one external image is loaded from a URL or an online service like Pravatar.
- [ ] Images use responsive techniques to display properly across different screen sizes.
- [ ] The code includes comments or documentation explaining the approach to image loading and where each image source is used.
- [ ] The app correctly imports and renders images from a variety of sources (e.g., static files, URLs).

## Getting Started

1. Use the code in the code folder
2. Run the application with `npm run dev`.
3. Review the existing components and locate where you’ll be adding images.
4. Try importing and displaying images from different sources:
   - Use a local file (e.g., `/src/assets/profile1.jpg`).
   - Fetch an image from an external URL, such as [Pravatar](https://i.pravatar.cc/150?u=fake@pravatar.com).
5. Ensure images display as expected across different screen sizes.

## Submission

Once you have completed this exercise, submit your work with:

1. A brief description of the techniques you used to load images.
2. Screenshots of the application displaying images from both local files and external URLs.
