# React in Style

## Challenge

Take the simple React app example and add your own style! In the example application, you’ll find four different methods for applying CSS styles in a React application:

1. Inline styles
2. CSS stylesheets
3. CSS modules
4. Styled-components (or another CSS-in-JS library)

Your task is to apply at least two different styling methods to enhance the application visually. Customise the design to make it your own by using multiple styling techniques.

## Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- Learn the different ways to apply CSS styles in a React application.
- Gain experience with inline styling, CSS stylesheets, CSS modules, and CSS-in-JS libraries like styled-components.
- Understand when and why to choose each styling method based on the requirements of a React project.

## User Story

As a developer, I want to practice using different styling methods in React so that I can create visually appealing applications and choose the most suitable styling approach for my projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The application is a simple React app that displays content styled in multiple ways.
- [ ] Inline styles are applied to at least one component.
- [ ] CSS stylesheets are used to add styles to the application’s layout or components.
- [ ] CSS modules are implemented to style at least one component with scoped, component-specific styles.
- [ ] An alternative CSS-in-JS solution, such as styled-components or Emotion, is used to style one or more components.
- [ ] The application demonstrates the visual differences between these styling methods, showing that at least two are used in distinct parts of the app.

## Getting Started

1. cd into the code folder, install dependencies with `npm install`.
2. Run the application with `npm run dev`.
3. Review the existing components and add your own styling by using at least two of the four different methods outlined above.
4. Check that each style is applied correctly and creates a clear visual change in the application.
