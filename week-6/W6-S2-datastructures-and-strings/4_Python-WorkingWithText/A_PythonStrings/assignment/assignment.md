# 🐍 **Assignment: Advanced Python Strings**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Your task is to create a Python program that demonstrates advanced string manipulations. This assignment will challenge you to utilize various string operations, incorporating concepts from dictionaries and user input.

## 📚 **Key Learnings**

By completing this assignment, you will:

- 🔍 Understand the creation and initialization of strings using different quoting methods.
- 🧵 Learn to perform string concatenation and formatting effectively.
- 📏 Explore string slicing to extract meaningful substrings.
- 🔄 Practice using common string methods for text manipulation.
- 📚 Implement dictionaries to store and manipulate string data.

## 👤 **User Story**

As a developer, I want to manipulate strings and store related information in a dictionary so that I can process and format text for various applications.

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

- **📝 Create a Python script named** `YOURNAME_W6S2_4_A_assignment.py`.
- The script should demonstrate the following:
  - ✨ Creation of strings using single, double, and triple quotes.
  - 🚩 Concatenation of multiple strings using the `+` operator and formatted strings (f-strings).
  - 🌀 Use of string slicing to extract specific parts of a string.
  - 🔄 Demonstration of at least four common string methods (e.g., `upper()`, `strip()`, `replace()`, and `find()`) and their results.
  - 📚 Utilize a dictionary to store user information (e.g., name, age, favorite color) and manipulate these strings based on user input.
  - 💬 The code must be well-commented and organized for clarity.

## 🛠️ **Steps to Complete**

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name it `YOURNAME_W6S2_4_A_assignment.py`.
2. **🖊️ Initialize strings**:
   - Create examples of strings using single quotes, double quotes, and triple quotes.
3. **🔗 Concatenate strings**:
   - Use the `+` operator to concatenate a greeting with a user's name and format it using f-strings.
4. **✂️ Slice strings**:
   - Demonstrate string slicing to extract specific words or characters from a string.
5. **🔄 Use common string methods**:
   - Apply at least four common string methods on your strings and print the results, explaining their purpose.
6. **📥 Get user input**:
   - Prompt the user to input their name, age, and favorite color. Store this information in a dictionary.
7. **📚 Manipulate dictionary values**:
   - Use string methods to format the dictionary values (e.g., convert the name to uppercase, strip extra spaces from the favorite color) and print the updated dictionary.
8. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.
