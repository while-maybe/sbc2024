# 🐍 **Assignment: Python Dictionaries**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Your task is to create a Python program that demonstrates a deeper understanding of dictionaries, including nested dictionaries, dynamic insertion of key-value pairs, merging dictionaries, and conditional updates.

## 📚 **Key Learnings**

By completing this assignment, you will:

- 🔍 Deepen your understanding of **Python dictionaries** and their usage.
- 🧵 Work with **nested dictionaries** to represent more complex data.
- 🔄 Dynamically add key-value pairs using **loops**.
- 🌀 Practice **merging dictionaries** and resolving potential key conflicts.
- 🚩 Use **conditional logic** when updating values in a dictionary.

## 👤 **User Story**

As a developer, I want to efficiently manipulate and update dictionaries in Python, even with complex data structures, so that I can handle more use cases.

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

- **📝 Create a Python script named** `YOURNAME_W6S2_3_B_assignment.py`.
- The script should demonstrate the following:
  - ✨ Create a **nested dictionary** that contains information about people, with each person having attributes like "name", "age", and "email".
  - 🔄 Dynamically add new key-value pairs to the dictionary using a loop, such as adding a unique ID for each person.
  - 📋 Merge two dictionaries and handle any potential key conflicts.
  - 🛠️ Use **conditional logic** to update dictionary values, ensuring the update happens only if certain conditions are met.
  - 📤 Print the dictionary after each modification to show the changes.
  - 💬 Ensure that the code is properly commented and organized for clarity.

## 🛠️ **Steps to Complete**

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name it `YOURNAME_W6S2_3_B_assignment.py`.
2. **👥 Create a nested dictionary**:
   - Define a dictionary that contains multiple people, each represented by their own dictionary with details like name, age, and email.
3. **🔄 Dynamically add key-value pairs**:
   - Use a loop to add a unique ID for each person in the dictionary.
4. **🌀 Merge dictionaries**:
   - Create a second dictionary and merge it with the original dictionary.
   - If the same key exists in both dictionaries, decide how to handle the conflict (e.g., update or skip).
5. **🛠️ Conditional updates**:
   - Add logic to update the dictionary values only if a condition is met (e.g., only update if the person’s age is above a certain number).
6. **📤 Print the output**: Use `print()` to show the dictionary’s state after each operation.
7. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.
