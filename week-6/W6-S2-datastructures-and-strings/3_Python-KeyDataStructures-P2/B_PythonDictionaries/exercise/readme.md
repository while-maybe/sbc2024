# 🐍 Python Dictionaries

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of dictionaries. Focus on creating, accessing, and manipulating dictionary elements.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to create and use dictionaries in Python.
- Accessing and modifying dictionary elements.
- Common dictionary operations such as adding, removing, and updating key-value pairs.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to use dictionaries effectively for storing and manipulating key-value pairs.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `dictionaries.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Dictionary creation and initialization.
  - Accessing and modifying dictionary elements.
  - Common dictionary operations like adding, updating, and removing key-value pairs.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `dictionaries.py`.

2. **🖊️ Initialize a dictionary**: Create a dictionary with some sample key-value pairs. For example, `my_dict = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}`.

3. **🔍 Access elements**: Demonstrate how to access values using keys. For example, `my_dict['name']`.

4. **✏️ Update elements**: Show how to update values associated with a specific key. For example, `my_dict['age'] = 26`.

5. **🔗 Add new key-value pairs**: Add new entries to the dictionary. For example, `my_dict['email'] = 'alice@example.com'`.

6. **🔄 Remove key-value pairs**: Demonstrate how to remove elements using `pop()` or `del`. For example, `my_dict.pop('city')` or `del my_dict['name']`.

7. **🔄 Iterate through the dictionary**: Use a loop to print each key-value pair in the dictionary.

8. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each operation to verify that the dictionary operations work as expected.

9. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Dictionaries in Python are mutable and unordered collections of key-value pairs.
- Use dictionary methods like `.keys()`, `.values()`, and `.items()` for various operations.
