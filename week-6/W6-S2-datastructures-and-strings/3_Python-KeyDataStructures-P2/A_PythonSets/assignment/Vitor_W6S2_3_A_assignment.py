# Generate two sets

import random
set1 = set(random.randint(1, 10) for _ in range(10)) # randint sometimes generates a number that is already present in the set so it may be that the set length varies
set2 = set(random.randint(5, 15) for _ in range(10))
print(set1, set2)

# Perform set operations

# Use union, intersection, and difference to manipulate the sets

# Print the results for each operation

# Add and remove elements

# Use set comprehension - Generate a new set containing only even numbers from one of the original sets using set comprehension.

# Print the output
