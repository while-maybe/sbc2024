# 🐍 Python Sets

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of sets. Focus on creating, accessing, and manipulating set elements.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to create and use sets in Python.
- Accessing and modifying set elements.
- Common set operations such as union, intersection, and difference.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to use sets effectively for storing unique elements and performing set operations.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `sets.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Set creation and initialization.
  - Accessing and modifying set elements.
  - Common set operations like union, intersection, and difference.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `sets.py`.

2. **🖊️ Initialize sets**: Create sets with some sample values. For example, `set1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}` and `set2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}`.

3. **🔍 Access elements**: Demonstrate how to access elements of a set (note that sets are unordered, so access is typically done through operations rather than indexing).

4. **🔗 Union of sets**: Use the `union()` method or the `|` operator to find the union of two sets. For example, `set1.union(set2)`.

5. **🔄 Intersection of sets**: Use the `intersection()` method or the `&` operator to find the intersection of two sets. For example, `set1.intersection(set2)`.

6. **🔄 Difference of sets**: Use the `difference()` method or the `-` operator to find the difference between two sets. For example, `set1.difference(set2)`.

7. **➕ Add and remove elements**: Show how to add elements using the `add()` method and remove elements using the `remove()` method.

8. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each operation to verify that the set operations work as expected.

9. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Sets automatically discard duplicate elements and are useful for operations involving unique items.
- Be cautious with the `remove()` method, as it raises a KeyError if the element is not found in the set.
