# üêç Python Error Handling, Exceptions, Classes, and Objects

## üéØ Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates both exception handling and the use of classes and objects. This includes handling exceptions using `try`, `except`, `finally`, raising custom exceptions, and defining classes with attributes and methods.

## üìö Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions in Python.
- How to raise custom exceptions with meaningful messages.
- The importance of exception handling for creating robust applications.
- How to define and instantiate classes.
- How to use methods and attributes within classes.
- The concepts of encapsulation and object-oriented programming.

## üë§ User Story

As a Python developer, I want to handle potential errors in my code gracefully while also being able to create and manage real-world entities through classes and objects.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script demonstrates:
  - Catching exceptions using `try` and `except` blocks.
  - Raising custom exceptions using `raise`.
  - Using `finally` to execute code regardless of exceptions.
  - Defining a class with attributes and methods.
  - Creating instances (objects) of the class.
  - Accessing and modifying attributes.
  - Calling methods on objects.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Complete

1. **Create a new Python file**: Name the file `erroroops.py`.

2. **Implement Exception Handling**:
   - Set up a `try` and `except` block to catch common exceptions.
   - Handle multiple exceptions in a single `try` block.
   - Use `finally` to ensure some code runs regardless of whether an exception occurred.
   - Raise a custom exception with a meaningful message.
   - Print results to demonstrate exception handling.

3. **Define Classes and Create Objects**:
   - Define a class with an `__init__` method to initialize attributes.
   - Add methods within the class to perform actions or calculations.
   - Instantiate objects from the class and demonstrate accessing their attributes and methods.
   - Print results to verify that the class and its methods work as expected.

4. **Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Exception handling is essential for creating robust applications.
- Use the `__init__` method to initialize class attributes.
- Methods within a class should have `self` as their first parameter to access instance attributes.
