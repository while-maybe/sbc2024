# 🐍 ** Assignment: Control Flow**

## 🎯 **Objective**

In this  assignment, you will explore advanced concepts of Python iterators, comprehensions, and loops. The focus will be on creating custom iterators, leveraging comprehensions for data transformation, and effectively using loops for data manipulation. By the end of this assignment, you should have a solid understanding of these essential Python techniques.

## 📚 **Key Learnings**

By completing this assignment, you will:

- 🛠️ Gain in-depth knowledge of Python iterators and their usage.
- 💡 Master list, set, and dictionary comprehensions for data manipulation.
- 🔄 Understand how to implement loops and control flow statements in Python.
- 📊 Apply these techniques in real-world scenarios to process data efficiently.

## 👤 **User Story**

As an experienced developer, I want to implement advanced Python techniques for data processing and transformation, allowing for clean, efficient, and powerful code.

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

- **📝 Create a Python script named** `YOURNAME_W6_S3_6_assignment.py`.
- The script should include the following sections:

### 1. **Advanced Python Iterators**

- **✨ Custom Iterator Class**: Implement a custom iterator class that simulates the behavior of Python’s `iter()` and `next()` with a sequence of your choice.
- **🔄 Complex String Iterator**: Create an iterator for a string that yields each character in uppercase until a stopping character is reached.
- **📑 StopIteration Handling**: Handle `StopIteration` exceptions while iterating through a list.
- **📊 Built-in Functions with Iterators**: Use `enumerate()` and `zip()` to iterate over multiple iterables simultaneously.
- **🔗 Chained Iterators**: Chain two or more iterators to process data in multiple stages.

### 2. **Python Comprehensions for Data Manipulation**

- **✨ Advanced List Comprehension**: Generate a list of squares of all odd numbers between 1 and 20 using a single comprehension.
- **🔄 Nested List Comprehension**: Use a nested comprehension to flatten a 2D list into a 1D list.
- **📑 Set Comprehension with Conditions**: Create a set comprehension that filters and transforms data.
- **🔗 Complex Dictionary Comprehension**: Build a dictionary comprehension with conditional logic.
- **💡 Real-World Scenario**: Simulate processing log data and extract entries containing the word "ERROR".

### 3. **Mastering Python Loops**

- **✨ List Manipulation with Loops**: Iterate over a list of dictionaries representing students and print their names and grades.
- **🔄 Nested Loops**: Create a multiplication table (up to 10) using nested loops.
- **📑 Break and Continue Statements**: Count valid user input entries while ignoring invalid ones using `continue` and `break`.
- **🔗 Looping Through a Dictionary**: Iterate over a dictionary of stock prices and print those above a specified threshold.
- **💾 Data Filtering with Loops**: Filter and display odd numbers from a list using a loop.

## 🛠️ **Additional Challenges (Optional)**

- **🌀 Infinite Custom Iterator**: Create a custom iterator class that generates an infinite sequence of natural numbers.
- **🔄 Complex Chaining**: Extend chained iterators to apply multiple transformations.
- **⏳ Performance Benchmark**: Compare comprehensions with traditional for-loops for large datasets.
- **🌀 Advanced Input Validation**: Count the number of even and odd numbers separately in user inputs.
- **⏳ Time-Based Filtering**: Generate random stock prices and filter based on a threshold.
