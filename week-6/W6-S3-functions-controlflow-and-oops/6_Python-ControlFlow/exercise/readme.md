# 🐍 Python Programming Exercise

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a comprehensive Python script that demonstrates the use of iterators, comprehensions, and loops. You will integrate these concepts to efficiently process and manipulate collections of data.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to use Python iterators to traverse collections efficiently.
- The benefits of comprehensions for creating and transforming lists, sets, and dictionaries.
- How to utilize loops to iterate over data structures and control the flow of execution.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to write efficient and readable code that leverages iterators, comprehensions, and loops to manage and manipulate data.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `control_flow.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Using iterators with built-in collections.
  - Implementing list, set, and dictionary comprehensions.
  - Using `for` and `while` loops to iterate over sequences and manage flow with `break` and `continue` statements.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `control_flow.py`.

2. **🔗 Implement Iterators**:
   - Create a function that accepts a list and uses `iter()` and `next()` to iterate through the list.
   - Handle the `StopIteration` exception gracefully and print each element.

3. **🔄 Demonstrate Comprehensions**:
   - Use list comprehensions to create a new list that contains the squares of numbers from 1 to 10.
   - Create a set comprehension that generates a set of unique characters from a string.
   - Use dictionary comprehensions to create a dictionary mapping numbers to their squares.

4. **🔄 Use Loops**:
   - Write a `for` loop that iterates over the squares list and prints each square.
   - Create a `while` loop that sums numbers from 1 to 100, demonstrating the use of a condition to control the loop's execution.
   - Use `break` to exit the loop when a specific condition is met (e.g., when the sum exceeds 500) and use `continue` to skip printing even numbers.

5. **📤 Print Results**:
   - Print the results of your iterator function, the list of squares, the set of unique characters, and the dictionary of squares.
   - Print the final sum from your `while` loop.

6. **💬 Comment Your Code**: Ensure that each section of the script is well-commented to explain its purpose and functionality.

## Tips

- Leverage Python’s built-in functions to streamline your code.
- Remember that comprehensions can enhance the readability of your code compared to traditional loops.
