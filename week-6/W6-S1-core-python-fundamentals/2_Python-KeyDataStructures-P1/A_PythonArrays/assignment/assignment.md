# 📝 Python Arrays Assignment

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will create a Python script that demonstrates the use of arrays (lists) in a comprehensive manner. This includes creating, accessing, and manipulating array elements while utilizing various array methods from the official Python documentation.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this assignment, you will learn:

- How to create and use arrays in Python.
- Accessing and modifying array elements.
- Common array operations, including advanced array methods.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to effectively utilize various array functions to manage and manipulate collections of data.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `YOURNAME_W6S1_2_A_assignment.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Array creation and initialization.
  - Accessing and updating array elements.
  - Array operations using all methods available for lists in Python.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `YOURNAME_W6S1_2_A_assignment.py`.

2. **🖊️ Initialize an array**: Create an array (list) with some sample values. For example, `my_array = ["apple", "banana", "cherry", "date"]`.

3. **🔍 Access elements**: Demonstrate how to access individual elements of the array using indices. For instance, access the first and third elements, such as `my_array[0]` and `my_array[2]`.

4. **✏️ Update elements**: Show how to modify elements in the array. For example, change the value of the second element to "blueberry": `my_array[1] = "blueberry"`.

5. **🔗 Slice the array**: Use slicing to create a sub-array from the original array. For example, get elements from index 1 to 3: `my_array[1:4]`.

6. **➕ Add elements**: Use the `append()` method to add new elements to the array. For example, add "elderberry": `my_array.append("elderberry")`.

7. **➖ Remove elements**: Demonstrate how to remove elements from the array using the `remove()` method. For example, remove "date": `my_array.remove("date")`.

8. **🔄 Utilize all array methods**: Research the official Python documentation on lists and implement as many list methods as you can in your script. Some methods to consider include:
   - `insert()`
   - `extend()`
   - `pop()`
   - `clear()`
   - `index()`
   - `sort()`
   - `reverse()`
   - `count()`

   For a complete list of array methods and their descriptions, visit the [Python Lists Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists).

9. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each operation to verify that the array operations work as expected.

10. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Arrays (lists) in Python are versatile and can store multiple data types.
- Use list comprehensions for efficient data processing and manipulation.

## Submission

Once you complete the assignment, submit the `YOURNAME_W6S1_2_A_assignment.py` file.

Happy coding, and good luck Geeks!
