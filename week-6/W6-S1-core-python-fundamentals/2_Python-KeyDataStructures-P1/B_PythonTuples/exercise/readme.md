# 🐍 Python Tuples

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of tuples. Focus on creating, accessing, and manipulating tuple elements.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will learn:

- How to create and use tuples in Python.
- Accessing and modifying tuple elements.
- Common tuple operations such as slicing and iteration.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to understand how to use tuples effectively for storing fixed-size, immutable sequences of data.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `tuples.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - Tuple creation and initialization.
  - Accessing tuple elements.
  - Tuple operations like slicing and iteration.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `tuples.py`.

2. **🖊️ Initialize a tuple**: Create a tuple with some sample values. For example, `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)`.

3. **🔍 Access elements**: Demonstrate how to access individual elements of the tuple using indices. For example, access the first and third elements.

4. **🔗 Slice the tuple**: Use slicing to create a sub-tuple from the original tuple. For example, get elements from index 1 to 3.

5. **🔄 Iterate through the tuple**: Use a loop to print each element of the tuple.

6. **🔄 Concatenate tuples**: Show how to concatenate tuples to create a new tuple. For example, `tuple1 + tuple2`.

7. **🔄 Repeat tuples**: Demonstrate how to repeat tuples using multiplication. For example, `my_tuple * 2`.

8. **📤 Print results**: Print the results of each operation to verify that the tuple operations work as expected.

9. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Tips

- Tuples are immutable, meaning they cannot be modified after creation.
- Use tuples for fixed-size collections of items.
