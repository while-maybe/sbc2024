# 🐍 **Assignment: Advanced Python Variables and Constants**

## 🎯 **Objective**

Your task is to create a Python program that demonstrates a deeper understanding of variables, constants, and mutable/immutable data types. This assignment will challenge you to utilize the concepts learned in the example and exercise files.

## 📚 **Key Learnings**

By completing this assignment, you will:

- 🔍 Understand the concept of **variables and constants** in Python.
- 🧵 Learn to define and use variables and constants effectively.
- 📏 Explore Python’s conventions for **variable naming** and **scope**.
- 🔄 Practice using different **data types**, including **mutable** and **immutable** types.

## 👤 **User Story**

As a developer, I want to use variables and constants efficiently so that I can write clean and maintainable code.

## ✅ **Acceptance Criteria**

- **📝 Create a Python script named** `YOURNAME_W6S1_1_A_assignment.py`.
- The script should demonstrate the following:
  - ✨ Variable declaration and assignment, showcasing both **mutable** (e.g., lists, dictionaries) and **immutable** (e.g., integers, strings, tuples) data types.
  - 🚩 Use of constants and how to define them using naming conventions (e.g., uppercase names).
  - 🌀 Show the concept of **mutable vs immutable** by modifying a list and an integer.
  - 🔄 Illustrate the difference between **shallow** and **deep copies** of a list.
  - 📏 Proper variable naming conventions should be followed.
  - 💬 The code must be properly commented and organized for clarity.

## 🛠️ **Steps to Complete**

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name it `YOURNAME_W6S1_1_A_assignment.py`.
2. **🖊️ Declare variables**:
   - Create examples of different types of variables (integer, float, string, boolean).
3. **🔒 Define constants**:
   - Use uppercase names to define constants that do not change throughout the program.
4. **🔄 Showcase mutability**:
   - Create examples of mutable (e.g., list, dictionary) and immutable (e.g., integer, string) data types.
   - Modify the list and show how it reflects the changes, whereas modifying the integer creates a new object.
5. **📤 Print the output**: Use `print()` to show the values of the variables and constants, and any operations performed on them.
6. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.
