# 🐍 Python Variables and Constants

## 🎯 Challenge

Your challenge is to create a Python script that demonstrates the use of variables and constants. The script should include examples of proper naming conventions and the use of constants.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this exercise, you will:

- 🔎 Understand the concept of variables and constants in Python.
- ✍️ Learn to define and use variables and constants effectively.
- 📏 Explore Python’s conventions for variable naming and scope.
- 🛠️ Practice using different data types, including numeric, string, and boolean types.

## 👤 User Story

As a developer, I want to use variables and constants efficiently so that I can write clean and maintainable code.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- 📝 A Python script named `variables_and_constants.py` is created.
- The script demonstrates the following:
  - ✨ Variable declaration and assignment.
  - 🚩 Use of constants and how to define them using naming conventions (e.g., uppercase names).
  - 🔄 Examples of immutable (int, string, tuple) data types.
- Proper variable naming conventions are followed.
- 🗒️ The code is properly commented and organized.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `variables_and_constants.py`.
2. **🖊️ Declare variables**: Create examples of different types of variables (integer, float, string, boolean).
3. **🔒 Define constants**: Use uppercase names to define constants that do not change throughout the program.
4. **📤 Print the output**: Use `print()` to show the values of the variables and constants, and any operations performed on them.
5. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.
