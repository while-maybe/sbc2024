# 📝 Mocking Assignment

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will write a Python script that utilizes mocking techniques to test a function that interacts with an external service. You will implement tests that isolate the function from its dependencies using mocking. This is similar to the exercise file that we did in class.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this assignment, you will learn:

- How to effectively use mocking to isolate tests from external dependencies.
- Best practices for writing reliable and independent tests.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to apply mocking techniques in my tests to ensure that they do not rely on external services, resulting in faster and more reliable execution.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `YOURNAME_W7S3_1_assignment.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - A function that performs a task using an external service (e.g., fetching user data from an API).
  - Tests that use mocking to verify the behavior of the function without actually calling the external service.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `YOURNAME_W7S3_1_assignment.py`.

2. **🖊️ Write a function**: Create a Python function that interacts with an external service (e.g., fetching user data from an API).

3. **✏️ Write tests without mocking**: Write a test for the function without using mocking to demonstrate its limitations.

4. **🔍 Implement mocking**: Use the `unittest.mock` library to mock the external service in your test.

5. **📤 Print results**: Ensure that your results include the outcomes of your tests.

6. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Advanced Challenge (Optional)

- Explore using fixtures in conjunction with mocking to manage complex setups in your tests.

## Submission

Once you complete the assignment, submit the `YOURNAME_W7S3_1_A_assignment.py` file.

Good luck, and happy mocking!
