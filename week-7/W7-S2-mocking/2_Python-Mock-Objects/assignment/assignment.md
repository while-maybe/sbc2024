# 📝 Mock Objects Assignment

## 🎯 Assignment Overview

In this assignment, you will create a Python script that demonstrates the use of mock objects. You will write a service that interacts with an external component and test its behavior using mock objects.

## 📚 Key Learnings

By completing this assignment, you will learn:

- How to create and use mock objects in your tests.
- Best practices for isolating components during testing.

## 👤 User Story

As a Python developer, I want to implement mock objects in my tests to ensure that I can isolate and verify the functionality of individual components.

## ✅ Acceptance Criteria

- The Python script is named `YOURNAME_W7S3_2_assignment.py`.
- The script demonstrates:
  - A class that interacts with an external service or component.
  - Tests that use mock objects to verify the behavior of the class without relying on the actual external component.

## 🛠️ Steps to Complete

1. **📁 Create a new Python file**: Name the file `YOURNAME_W7S3_2_assignment.py`.

2. **🖊️ Write a class with an external dependency**: Create a Python class that interacts with another class or service.

3. **✏️ Write tests using mock objects**: Write tests for the class that utilize mock objects to isolate the functionality being tested.

4. **📤 Print results**: Ensure that your results include the outcomes of your tests.

5. **💬 Comment your code**: Ensure that each section of the script is properly commented for clarity.

## Advanced Challenge (Optional)

- Implement multiple mock objects to simulate different behaviors and test your class against them.

## Submission

Once you complete the assignment, submit the `YOURNAME_W7S3_2_assignment.py` file.

Good luck, and happy mocking!
