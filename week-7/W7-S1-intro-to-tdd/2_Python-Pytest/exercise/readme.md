# üìö  Exercises on Pytest

Welcome to the  exercises focused on `pytest`, a powerful testing framework for Python. This README covers the essentials of writing and organizing tests effectively.

## üêç Overview of Exercises

### Exercise 1: pytest Basics - Writing and Running Unit Tests

**Challenge:**  
Implement a simple class and write test cases using `pytest`.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Writing and running unit tests with `pytest`.
- Using assertions to verify function correctness.
- Handling exceptions in tests.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Create a class `DataProcessor` with methods for string manipulation and list processing.
- Write corresponding test functions for each method.
- Handle exceptions gracefully.

**File:** `pytest_basics.py`

### Exercise 2: pytest Fixtures - Reusing Setup Code

**Challenge:**  
Create a Python class that represents a simple system and write test cases using `pytest` fixtures for setup and teardown.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Writing reusable test setup and teardown code using fixtures.
- Managing test environments efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Implement a class (e.g., `FileSystem` or `DatabaseConnection`).
- Create a `pytest` fixture for managing resources.
- Write test cases utilizing the fixture.

**File:** `pytest_fixtures.py`

### Exercise 3: Test Parametrization with pytest

**Challenge:**  
Create a set of parameterized tests for a function of your choice using `pytest`'s `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.

**Key Learnings:**  
- Benefits of test parametrization in reducing code duplication.
- Running multiple test cases with various inputs efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**  
- Define a function to test.
- Write at least three parameterized test cases.

**File:** `parametrized_tests.py`

## üõ†Ô∏è General Steps for Each Exercise

1. **Create a new Python file** for each exercise.
2. **Write your code** following the challenge guidelines.
3. **Develop test cases** ensuring clarity and coverage of edge cases.
4. **Run your tests using pytest** to verify all pass successfully.
5. **Comment your code** adequately to enhance readability.
